      "   Last December, the U.S. Surgeon General's office held a workshop\n",

      "   A major supporter of alcohol labeling has been the Center for\n",

      "   ``You might have young people who think that their parents who\n",

      "   Anheuser, based in St. Louis, is expanding its ``Know when to\n",

      "the company will incorporate a message of moderation into another\n",
      "campaign, to begin running later this year, which will trace the\n",
      "tradition of beer through history.\n",
      "   One ad will use early American paintings to show how beer was\n",
